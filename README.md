### Advanced Features

#### Modified line exec command

This optional feature allows for the injection of an `exec` action after modified lines, where modified is determined as a changed action, command, or reference. This can be used to amend commits to update references in the commit message or run a test suite only on modified commits.

To enable this option, set the `interactive-rebase-tool.postModifiedLineExecCommand` option, providing an executable or script.

```shell
git config --global interactive-rebase-tool.postModifiedLineExecCommand "/path/to/global/script"
```

Or using repository-specific configuration, for targeted scripts.

```shell
git config --global interactive-rebase-tool.postModifiedLineExecCommand "/path/to/repo/script"
```

The first argument provided to the script will always be the action performed. Then, depending on the action, the script will be provided a different set of arguments.

For `drop`, `fixup`, `edit`, `pick`, `reword` and `squash` actions, the script will additionally receive the original commit hash, for `exec` the original and new commands are provided, and for `label`, `reset`, `merge`, and `update-ref` the original label/reference and new label/reference are provided.

Full example of a resulting rebase todo file, assuming that `interactive-rebase-tool.postModifiedLineExecCommand` was set to `script.sh`.

```
# original line: label onto
label new-onto
exec script.sh "label" "onto" "new-onto"

# original line: reset onto
reset new-onto
exec script.sh "reset" "onto" "new-onto"

pick   a12345 My feature
# original line: pick b12345 My change
squash b12345 My change
exec script.sh "squash" "b12345"

# original line: label branch
label branch
exec script.sh "label" "branch" "new-branch"

# original line: exec command
exec new-command
exec script.sh "exec" "command" "new-command"
```

## Setup

### Most systems

    git config --global sequence.editor interactive-rebase-tool

### Windows

#### Standard Command Prompt and Windows Terminal

    git config --global sequence.editor "'C:/path/to/interactive-rebase-tool.exe'"

#### GitBash

GitBash requires the use of `winpty` in order to work correctly, so to set the editor use:

    git config --global sequence.editor "winpty /c/path/to/interactive-rebase-tool.exe"

#### Notes

Windows before version 10 has [serious rendering issues with saturated darker colors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/updating-the-windows-console-colors/), such as the blue color that is entirely illegible on modern displays. While it is possible to avoid using saturated colors, a better option is to update the theme using Microsoft's [ColorTool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal/tree/master/src/tools/ColorTool).


### Temporary Override

You can temporarily use a different sequence editor by using the `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` environment variable:

    GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=emacs git rebase -i [<upstream> [<branch>]]

## Direct Usage

```shell
interactive-rebase-tool <rebase-todo-filepath>
interactive-rebase-tool --help
interactive-rebase-tool --version
```

### Getting Help

The tool has built-in help that can be accessed by using the `?` key.

### Common Default Key Bindings

Key bindings can be customized, see [configuration](readme/customization.md#key-bindings) for all key bindings and information on configuring.

## Development

### Install Rust

To start developing the project, you will need to [install Rust][install-rust], which can generally be done using [rustup].

### Setup

#### Cargo Make

This project uses [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) as a task runner. To install:

    cargo install --force cargo-make

#### Debian and derivatives

If you plan to build a release package you will need `pkg-config` and `liblzma-dev`. They can be installed using `apt`:

    sudo apt install pkg-config liblzma-dev

### Build and run

To build or run the project, from the project root run:

    # only build
    cargo make build --release
    # build and run
    cargo run -- <path-to-git-rebase-todo-file>

Sample rebase todo files can be found in ./test/fixtures.

### Tests

Automated tests are available for all features and can be run with:

    cargo make test

### Docs

API docs for the project are generated using Rust Doc:

    cargo make docs

### Linting

An addition to the lints provided by rustc, this project uses Clippy to provide additional linting, run with:

    cargo make lint

This will run lints using stable and nightly. The nightly lints may show errors, but will not result in a failure.

### Format

This project uses rust-fmt to provide a consistent format. A helpful script will ensure that all files are formatted correctly:

    cargo make format

### Coverage

The project use [Tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) to generate coverage reports. Coverage reports are used to find gaps in tests. To generate the coverage report:

    cargo make coverage

An addition to the report printed to the CLI, an HTML report can be found in the `coverage` directory.

### Release

#### Debian Building

    cargo make deb

A deb file will be written to `target/debian/interactive-rebase-tool_*.deb`.

#### Reproducible Builds

Providing a [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/#idm55) environment variable with a valid UNIX timestamp, defined in seconds, will ensure a reproducible build.
