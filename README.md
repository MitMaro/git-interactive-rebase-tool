## Setup

### Most systems

    git config --global sequence.editor interactive-rebase-tool

### Windows

#### Standard Command Prompt

    git config --global sequence.editor "'C:/path/to/interactive-rebase-tool.exe'"

#### GitBash

GitBash requires the use of `winpty` in order to work correctly, so to set the editor use:

    git config --global sequence.editor "winpty /c/path/to/interactive-rebase-tool.exe"

#### Notes

Windows before version 10 has [serious rendering issues with saturated darker colors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/updating-the-windows-console-colors/), such as the blue color that is entirely illegible on modern displays. While it is possible to avoid using saturated colors, a better option is to update the theme using Microsoft's [ColorTool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal/tree/master/src/tools/ColorTool).


### Temporary Override

You can temporarily use a different sequence editor by using the `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` environment variable:

    GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=emacs git rebase -i [<upstream> [<branch>]]

## Usage

```shell
interactive-rebase-tool <rebase-todo-filepath>
interactive-rebase-tool --help
interactive-rebase-tool --version
```

### Getting Help

The tool has built-in help that can be accessed by hitting the `?` key.

### Setup

#### Debian and derivatives

If you plan to build a release package you will need `pkg-config` and `liblzma-dev`. They can be installed using `apt`:

    sudo apt install pkg-config liblzma-dev

### Build and run

Use cargo to build and run the project. From the project root run:

    # only build
    cargo build --release
    # build and run
    cargo run -- <path-to-git-rebase-todo-file>


### Tests

Automated tests are available for all features and ran be run with:

    cargo test

### Linting

The project uses Clippy to provide additional linting, run with:

    ./scripts/lint.bash

### Format

This project uses rust-fmt to provide a consistent format. A helpful script will ensure that all files are formatted correctly:

    ./scripts/format.bash

### Release

##### Install Cargo Deb

    cargo install cargo-deb

##### Building

    cargo build --release
    cargo deb

A deb file will be written to `target/debian/interactive-rebase-tool_*.deb`.
